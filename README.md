## Description
This project is a personal learning journey, designed to help me explore Cloud computing while using modern web development technologies. The _Bucket List Tracker App_ is a simple yet functional application that showcases how users can manage their wishes through an intuitive interface. It demonstrates my growing proficiency in building full-stack applications while working with tools such as:


- _AWS Amplify_ for backend services and deployment
- _React_ for building the user interface
- _Typescript_ for enhanced code quality and maintainability

This application is a work-in-progress, and I continue to refine it as I learn and incorporate new concepts.


## Usage
The application is deployed [here](https://main.d3tqlmugnpzjb5.amplifyapp.com/).

If you want to run it on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
